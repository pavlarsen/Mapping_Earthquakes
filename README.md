The purpose of this project is to create an earthquake map with 3 different map styles (steet, satellite & outdoors). This map shows earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location an a filter to visualize earthquakes with a magnitude greate than 4.5.

With this map, it is possible to filter only relevant earthquakes with magnitudes above 4.5


### Outdoor map
